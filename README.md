**`Digital Craftsman (Computer Scientist, Future Software Engineer, Developer)`**

I'm working hard on becoming a full-stack developer / software engineer. I focus on personal projects to build and diversify my portfolio. All projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I have my own personal which is linked to my profile. Feel free to follow me and look at some of my projects that I've worked on.

    <summary><h3>üìö Why I Started</h3></summary>
        I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I was older... I had a great passion for tech and everything tech related. I love computers. From building them, to troubleshooting them, overclocking, anything technical, I have done and can do. I learnt Python in my computer class at school, and began to develop a passion for coding. After that, I realised I could be a software engineer, code for big companies. However, I knew I had to learn a more sophisticated language if I wanted to have a chance at even cracking FAANG or a high paid software engineering job. Everything changed when I started learning C++. As of writing this, I'm roughly about a week in. I've enjoyed every second of it, everyday I learn something new and chalenge myself further to see what I'm capable of. I'm 15, with many years ahead of me, and I will crack FAANG and I will make it into the high-end side of th tech industry.
