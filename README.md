**`Digital Craftsman (Computer Scientist, Future Software Engineer, Developer)`**

I'm working hard on becoming a full-stack developer / software engineer. I focus on personal projects to build and diversify my portfolio. All projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I have my own personal which is linked to my profile. Feel free to follow me and look at some of my projects that I've worked on.
